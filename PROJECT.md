# TaskApp - Gamified Task Management System

## Project Overview

TaskApp is a gamified task management application designed to help children develop good habits and skills through a reward-based system. The application uses a token economy where children can earn tokens by completing tasks and spend them in a virtual shop.

## Core Features

### 1. Task Management System

- [ ] Task creation and management
- [ ] Task assignment to children
- [ ] Task completion tracking
- [ ] Task pausing functionality
- [ ] Streak tracking for consistent task completion

### 2. Child Management

- [ ] Multiple child profiles
- [ ] Individual progress tracking
- [ ] Skill development tracking

### 3. Reward System

- [ ] Token-based economy
- [ ] Virtual shop with purchasable items
- [ ] Transaction history
- [ ] Purchase tracking

### 4. Skill Development

- [ ] Skill categorization
- [ ] Task-skill association
- [ ] Progress tracking

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Laravel (PHP)
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: Radix UI, Headless UI
- **Build Tools**: Vite
- **Development Tools**: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript

## Current Implementation Status

### Data Models (Implemented)

1. **User** - Base user model for authentication
2. **Child** - Represents a child profile
3. **Task** - Core task management
4. **TaskAssignment** - Links tasks to children
5. **TaskPause** - Handles task pausing functionality
6. **Streak** - Tracks consecutive task completions
7. **TokenTransaction** - Records token movements
8. **ShopItem** - Virtual shop items
9. **Purchase** - Tracks item purchases
10. **Skill** - Represents different skills
11. **SkillTask** - Links tasks to skills

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow Laravel coding standards for PHP code

### Component Structure

- Use Radix UI for accessible components
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Follow React best practices for component organization

### State Management

- Use React hooks for local state
- Leverage Laravel's backend for data persistence

### Testing

- Write unit tests for critical functionality
- Use PHPUnit for backend testing
- Implement frontend testing where appropriate

## Future Considerations

### Scalability

- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimize database queries for performance
- Implement proper indexing for frequently queried fields

### Security

- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Secure API endpoints
- Protect sensitive data

### User Experience

- Implement responsive design for all screen sizes
- Add loading states and error handling
- Consider implementing offline capabilities

### Monitoring

- Implement logging for important actions
- Set up error tracking
- Monitor performance metrics
